# [How to] OK Blockchain [Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi]

When you load the OK Wallet for the first time it connects to the peer-to-peer network and starts to synchronize the OK blockchain. 

### When to use the ok-blockchain to Sync your OK wallet

The first time sync of the OK blockchain can take quite a while; sometimes up to 24 hours depending on your hardware. 

With OK you can speed up this process by loading compressed backups of the OK blockchain. 

Adding the current ok-blockchain to your local okcash data directory speeds up the synchronization process which will get your wallet up and running in minutes.

### How to use the ok-blockchain to sync your OK wallet

1.- Close the OK Wallet and download the latest ok-blockchain.rar file.

2.- Place the ok-blockchain.rar file in the Okcash data directory, location depends on your operating system.

3.- Unrar the ok-blockchain.rar file. (includes txleveldb folder + blk0001.dat files)

4.- Start your OK Wallet and give it some minutes to finish it's first time Sync process. 
(The client might be unresponsive but don’t worry - it’s just loading and verifying all the ok-blockchain data)

### Okcash config data directory location on different Operating Systems
(or just click on the "open config folder..." under the "Options" menu in the Okcash wallet).

Linux and IoT devices:

**~/.okcash/**

MacOS:

**~/Library/Application Support/Okcash/**

New MacOS:

**/Users/(username)/Library/Application Support/Okcash**

Windows:

**%APPDATA%\OKCash**

(This defaults to C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application data\OKCash on Windows XP and to C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\OKCash on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10.)
